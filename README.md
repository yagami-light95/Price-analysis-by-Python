An Analysis of Variables Affecting Car Prices in the US

This paper analyzed the variables affecting car price in the US, using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Using variable selection techniques such as VIF and OLS, we developed a regression model with an R-squared score 
of 0.8614, indicating a good fit between the model and the data. The most important variables that influence the price of a car were found to be ‘horsepower’, ‘carwidth’,‘hatchback’(Representing
a kind of ‘carbody’), and ‘highend’ (Representing luxury car brands, such as Porsche, BMW, etc.).
